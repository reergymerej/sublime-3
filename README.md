# Line Break
I always forget how to set this up, so here's my macro and keybinding from Sublime Text 3 for the next time I want to do this.

## Installation
1. Put `line-break.sublime-macro` in `Packages/User`.
1. Copy the binding from `Default (Windows).sublime-keymap` into the keybinding file.
